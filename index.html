        <p>Hello, my name is Erik Boerma.  Ever since I was a young boy, I've been facinated by technology.  My world started on one of the orignal Macintosh computers and progressed through windows where I enjoyed learning all about the innerworkings.  
        I started learning programming in highschool, starting with HTML and progressing to C++.
